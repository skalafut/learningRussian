# learningRussian
This repository holds a game and tools developed to help me learn Russian vocabulary.  However, these tools 
and game can be used with any language, given the appropriate input files.

The data directory contains text files needed to run the game.  The file data/englishToRussianList.txt
contains a list of English words and phrases, and their translations into Russian.  To use the game
for another language, the only change is that a different txt file should be used instead of
englishToRussianList.txt.  The txt file must separate the two translations with a colon.
The file data/gameScoreHistory.txt keeps track of information pertinent to the user's performance
in all prior games, including when the games were played, the number of words tested, and the
number of words translated correctly.
